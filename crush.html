<p>"Anitah,you I've been finding myself drawn to you lately, more than just as a friend.This is maybe due to the 
personality you have that dived me into this. 
You always seem to have the personality that i admire the most. 
I've found myself thinking about you a lot lately, and I wanted to be honest with you. 
I have feelings for you. Would you be open to exploring something?
